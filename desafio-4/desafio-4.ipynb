We can‚Äôt imagine what that means. The chatbot could support multiple input methods and generate results even faster. They might be even more accurate.‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs all really speculation, as we have no AGI model to compare ChatGPT with.

This would give it the ability to reason, and chatting with ChatGPT after the GPT-5 upgrade might resemble talking to a human. @karthiks Using Langchain with the GPT API and Pinecone seems like a low-effort way of doing more interesting tinkering with GPT than just asking chatGPT.\\n\\nI tried a trivial task of feeding it a long essay that I find hard to read and asking questions. https://t.co/UpwWqo14bo The GPT-4 upgrade gave ChatGPT tremendous new powers over the previous version, making the chatbot an even better tool. The generative AI supports multimodal input, which means you can feed it data via text and images to generate a response. It also supports multiple languages‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs incredibly exciting and scary at the same time, as we can‚Äôt comprehend what AGI will be able to do. While GPT-5 could make ChatGPT indistinguishable from a human, it‚Äôll still exceed the human mind‚Äôs capabilities in processing data and generating content. If a report about the GPT-5 abilities is correct, Open AI might be on the verge of achieving a massive milestone for ChatGPT. The generative AI might become indistinguishable from a human after the GPT-5 upgrade as it reaches artificial general intelligence (AGI).
